# 📜 Glossary

## 📍 Textmate

[Textmate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) is a powerful text editor for code, markup, and prose. It supports syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and snippets. It also has a built-in terminal, Git integration, and a file browser.

> Textmate is available since 2005 and in this age of modern editors we still use Textmate grammars and templates. That's why we need to know textmate rules etc.
